		a) Halt mode
		b) Sit Low Mode
		c) Sit High mode

		2. The figure shown in the StatMachineKrang.png describes what happens in response to each event
	How events are generated:

		2. Pressing button 9 generates "Quit" Event
		3. Pressing button 10 while button 6 is released generates "Sit" Event
		4. Pressing button 10 and 6 simultaneously generates "Stand" Event
		5. In each iteration either "Thresh Sit Down" or "Thresh Sit Up" Event is generated based on imu angle
		6. In each iteration either "Thresh Torso Low" or "Thresh Torso High" Event is generated based 
				on the waist angle
