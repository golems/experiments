Description of plots:
- 00042: Tried moving base with joystick while using TH gains the same that come out with 
Q(3,3)=1 and using KD_WH the one which comes out when Q(3,3)=100. The response to joystick
has improved. Position control not employed.

- 00049: Tried to make the system follow a sinusoidal trajectory with amp=1 and freq=1/6
the same gains as tried in 00042. The system refuses to move at all. Only the pendulum oscillates.

- 00050: Tried to make the system follow a sinusoidal trajectory with amp=1 and freq=1/20
the same gains as tried in 00042. The system refuses to move at all. Only the pendulum oscillates
but with a smaller frequency this time (as expected).

- 00051: Repeated the above experiment with a KD_TH gain double the previous (that comes out when
Q(3,3)=500). The system blew up in the balancing mode even before starting the track_sine mode.

- 00052-57: Ignore

- 00058: Experiment to find out the breakaway torque that starts the motion of the system. This is
done by incrementing the reference speed of the wheels in steps. The gains KP_TH and KD_TH are the
same as before KD_TH is three times smaller than before. Postion control (KP_TH) is off.

- 00063: The same experiment as 00050 with gains of 00058

- 00064: The same experiment as 00063 with krang on the cardboard

- 00065: Same as 00064 but with more inflated tires. Pressure changed from 23 psi to 36 psi.

- 00071: I changed the way the trajectories are being gnerated. Previously, the trajectory was a 
sine wave for the velocity reference and the corresponding position reference trajectory. Now, the 
trajectory is a sine wave for position reference with a corresponding velocity reference. This 
means that the intial velocity is 2*pi*f*amplitude, a non-zero value. This causes the initial
push for the wheels required to overcome friction. But, due to friction effects, the net 
displacement over time is positive i.e. the center about which the movement of wheels is taking 
place is shifting forward. This is a typical behavior resulting from friction as can be seen
in literature (see Figure 2 in "Adaptive friction compensation with partially known dynamic 
friction model, Canudas de Wit, 1998").

- 00077: Repetition of the same experiment for recording a video. Also Can started playing
and kicking the system to check out its response.

- 00078: The above experiment is now repeated with position control turned on. The result shows
a different behavior. This time, there is a net displacement of the right wheel in positive
direction and a net displacement of the left wheel in the negative direction. This causes a net
change in the heading direction towards the left. The center center of oscillations of wheels
however remains at the initial position.

- 00080: The above experiment was repeated for taking a video of the above turning behavior
observed. But the turning never happened this time. This time, both the wheels experienced a 
forward drift in the average displacements causing the heading direction to remain fixed.
Also, we put a turning disturbance on the robot but the controller tends to get back to
its initial heading direction over time.
