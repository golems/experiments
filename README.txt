This repo is to contain the code for development experiments that we do for
Krang. The following experiments have taken place so far:

1) Kinematics: Testing the Kinect output against the forward kinematics
2) Balancing
3) Grippers: Opening and closing grippers fully, ability to squeeze until 
	 a current limit
4) Manipulation: The two hands move (independently) to take objects from
   a desk, from each other and place them. Vision is incorporated.
