# format: [linearP linearI linearD angularP angularI angularD pb_alpha pb_beta]
# pb_alpha and pb_beta are parameters for an adaptive positional gain 
# for overcoming static friction which falls off as velocity increases:
# k_pb = pb_apha * exp(-pb_beta * ||v||)
# To disable adaptive gains, set pb_alpha=1 and pb_beta=0
